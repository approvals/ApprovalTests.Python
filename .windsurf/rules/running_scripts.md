**ALWAYS** add the STARTER_CHARACTER followed by space at the start of your reply. 
The STARTER_CHARACTER will change for each process file that is in progress.

Default STARTER_CHARACTER = ðŸ§©

## ApprovalTests

**NEVER** approve a test for us, the user will allways do that. If you believe the `.approved.` file needs to be changed, prompt the user.

## Git

- `git fetch` early and often

## Running Tests

- Run Tests with `.\build_and_test.cmd` or `./build_and_test.sh`.
- **ALWAYS** run the build_and_test script in blocking mode.


# Style
- Do not add comments to code unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- Only use Unix-style line endings (\n).
