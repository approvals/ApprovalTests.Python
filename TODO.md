- [ ] e uv cache doesn't respect `.python-version`
   - ideas/options:
      - clear the cache in `build_and_test`
      - use `uv pip --no-cache` DONE
         - problem: need to remember to rm the venv after changing python versions
         - idea: advertize the current actual python used version on every mise task execution 
      - guess: migrate to `pyproj.toml`, will solve this
         - how will we handle CI matrix?
      - write a `clean` script
          - git clean -xdf (to delete venv)
          - mise exec -- uv cache clean
          - mise uninstall --all
          - mise cache clear

      - define a custom cache key based on `.python-version`
      - in the python version checklist, clear cache
         - [ ] edit `.python-version`
         - [ ] run `uv cache clean`

- [ ] `set_python_version` script, which also removes the venv

- [ ] uninstall unmanaged uv from dev machine (~/.local/bin)
