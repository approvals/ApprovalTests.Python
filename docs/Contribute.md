### Opening Notice

# Values<!-- include: opening_notice.md -->
  We come together in order to accomplish the following 3 goals in priority order:

  1. Code: We want to get something shipped 
  1. Mobbing: This is a social event, group work, meet people, deal with conflicts/feelings, other human stuff 
  1. Learning: You are invited to join just to learn

  However, if there are conflicts between any of these, we will value them in the following order:
  Coding >> Mobbing >> Learning

  We strive to make this a **safe environment**. In order to achieve this, we agree to these responsibilities:
  * As an individual, I am responsible for asking for what I need. 
  * As participants in an ensemble, we are responsible for making this a safe place to do so
