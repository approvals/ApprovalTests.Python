## v 2.0.0
    
### Create regex scrubber
Renamed `scrub_with_regex` to `create_regex_scrubber`.  
It can now take either a `str` or a `Callable[[int], str]`

Going forward, functions that return scrubber will start with `create` while functions that scrub directly will start with `scrub`

## v 1.1.0

### Storyboards
See [Storyboard](reference/storyboard.md)
    
## v 1.0.0

### Verify(text) ensures a newline at the file
**BREAKING CHANGE**
Since most tools will ensure a newline at the end of a file, approval test is now
adding this to allow copying approval results in diff tools to work correctly.
Please note that this will break all you previous approvals that do *not* end with
a newline!

This will show by your diff tool opening with two files that look identical, but
one actually has a newline at the end.

#### Upgrade Path
We suggest you use `ReporterByCopyMoveCommandForEverythingToClipboard()` as your [Default Reporter](configuration.md#how-to-configure-a-default-reporter-for-your-system) to re-approve all your files.

### Namer handles multiple nested methods in a unit test
Previously if you had nested methods in your unit test, the names would incorrectly
identify the help method rather than the test method. This is now fixed.

## v 0.5.0
### Options - with file extension
If you want to set the extension of the approval file, you can now do it through the options.
