# Responsibilities of a Coach

*Work in questions, not commands.*

## Flow

Keep the group moving forward:

- Are people doing what they should be doing in their roles?
- Is someone stuck? → *"Do you know what your goal is?"*
- *"Does it work?"*
- *"Is it good?"*

## Cohesion

Keep the group together:

- Is someone lost?
