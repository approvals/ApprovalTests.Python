-   [ ] example use case for vcr-like functionality, for instance **prompt an llm to rename variable**
    -   expected behavior is:
        -   input: prompt (`"suggest a better name for var X in the following code"`)
            -   please rename the name foo to smthg better

                ---

                ```
                function foo(a,b) {
                return a +b
                }
                ```
        -   output:
-   [ ] build it
    -   [ ]
