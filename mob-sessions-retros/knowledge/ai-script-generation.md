Name: AI Script Generation

Pattern: have the AI generate a script to achieve a task rather than doing the task "manually".


Example task: group commits by ACN (Arlo's Commit Notation)

The AI could do this manually, but it's better to get it to generate a script to do it.

So, instead of asking "group commits by ACN", ask it to "write a script to group commits by ACN, and run it."
